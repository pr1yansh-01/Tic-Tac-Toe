# Tic Tac Toe

- **Live demo:** https://pr1yansh-01.github.io/Tic-Tac-Toe/

Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game where each player takes turns marking a 3×3 grid with X or O. The first to place three marks in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) wins. This project is implemented in React with CSS for styling.

## Game rules

1. The game is played on a grid that is 3 squares by 3 squares
2. You are X, your friend is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares
3. The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner
4. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over
